#  Coding Assessment for JR. Front-end Position

Welcome guuys!
In this project, I have coded an existing UI for an assessment using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript only.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my front-end development skills and provide a sample of my coding style.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

## Project details

I created this project as a part of a Jr position assessment, and it took me about 6 hours to complete.
The goal was to demonstrate my ability to recreate an existing UI using my front-end development skills.

All the animations for the web components were made using pure CSS

## Conclusion

Sadly, the position was put on hold... So I make this Repo anyways, I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and contribute to the tech community.
If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me.
